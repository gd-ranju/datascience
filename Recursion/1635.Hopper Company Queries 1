Write a solution to report the following statistics for each month of 2020:

The number of drivers currently with the Hopper company by the end of the month (active_drivers).
The number of accepted rides in that month (accepted_rides).
Return the result table ordered by month in ascending order, where month is the month's number (January is 1, February is 2, etc.).


WITH
    recursive Months AS (
        SELECT 1 AS month
        UNION ALL
        SELECT month + 1
        FROM Months
        WHERE month < 12
    ),
    Ride AS (
        SELECT MONTH(requested_at) AS month, COUNT(1) AS cnt
        FROM Rides AS r
        JOIN AcceptedRides AS a
            ON r.ride_id = a.ride_id AND YEAR(requested_at) = 2020
        GROUP BY month
    )
SELECT
    m.month,
    COUNT(DISTINCT d.driver_id) AS active_drivers,
    IFNULL(SUM(r.cnt), 0) AS accepted_rides  -- Use SUM to aggregate the cnt value
FROM
    Months AS m
LEFT JOIN Drivers AS d
    ON (YEAR(d.join_date) < 2020)  -- Drivers who joined before 2020
    OR (YEAR(d.join_date) = 2020 AND MONTH(d.join_date) <= m.month)  -- Drivers who joined in 2020 and before the current month
LEFT JOIN Ride AS r
    ON m.month = r.month
GROUP BY m.month
ORDER BY m.month;
