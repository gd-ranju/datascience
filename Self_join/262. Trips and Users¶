The cancellation rate is computed by dividing the number of canceled (by client or driver) requests with unbanned users by the total number of requests with unbanned users on that day.

Write a solution to find the cancellation rate of requests with unbanned users (both client and driver must not be banned) each day between "2013-10-01" and "2013-10-03" with at least one trip. Round Cancellation Rate to two decimal points.

Return the result table in any order.






-- Select the request date and compute the cancellation rate
SELECT
    request_at AS Day,  -- Extract the day of the trip request
    ROUND(AVG(status != 'completed'), 2) AS 'Cancellation Rate'  -- Calculate the percentage of non-completed trips
FROM
    Trips AS t
    -- Ensure the client is not banned
    JOIN Users AS u1 ON (t.client_id = u1.users_id AND u1.banned = 'No')
    -- Ensure the driver is not banned
    JOIN Users AS u2 ON (t.driver_id = u2.users_id AND u2.banned = 'No')
-- Filter for the requested date range
WHERE request_at BETWEEN '2013-10-01' AND '2013-10-03'
-- Group by each day to compute daily cancellation rates
GROUP BY request_at;
