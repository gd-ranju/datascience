Write a solution to report the IDs of the customers with the total purchases strictly increasing yearly.

The total purchases of a customer in one year is the sum of the prices of their orders in that year. If for some year the customer did not make any order, we consider the total purchases 0.
The first year to consider for each customer is the year of their first order.
The last year to consider for each customer is the year of their last order.



-- Common Table Expression (CTE) to calculate total spending per customer per year
WITH year_cte AS (
    SELECT  
        customer_id, 
        YEAR(order_date) AS year, 
        SUM(price) AS total 
    FROM Orders
    GROUP BY customer_id, year
    ORDER BY NULL  -- Optimizes performance by preventing unnecessary sorting
)

-- Selecting customers who spent more in every consecutive year
SELECT a.customer_id
FROM year_cte a 
-- Self-join to compare spending across consecutive years for the same customer
LEFT JOIN year_cte b
    ON b.customer_id = a.customer_id 
    AND b.year = a.year + 1  -- Ensures comparison with the next year
GROUP BY a.customer_id
-- Ensuring that for every year, spending is greater than or equal to the next year
HAVING SUM(a.total >= IFNULL(b.total, 0)) = 1
ORDER BY NULL;  -- Prevents unnecessary sorting for efficiency
