Write an SQL query to find the customers who have made consecutive transactions with increasing amount for at least three consecutive days. Include the customer_id, start date of the consecutive transactions period and the end date of the consecutive transactions period. There can be multiple consecutive transactions by a customer.

Return the result table ordered by customer_id in ascending order.





WITH
    ConsecutiveTransactions AS (
        -- Generate row numbers based on transaction date and amount to detect consecutive transactions
        SELECT
            t1.*,
            -- First row number for the transaction ordered by date
            ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY t1.customer_id ORDER BY t1.transaction_date) - 
            -- Second row number for the transaction ordered by both date and amount
            ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY t1.customer_id ORDER BY t1.transaction_date, t1.amount) AS grp
        FROM
            Transactions AS t1
    )
-- Select the customer ID and the start and end of each consecutive transaction streak
SELECT
    customer_id,
    -- Find the first transaction date in the consecutive group (start)
    MIN(transaction_date) AS consecutive_start,
    -- Find the last transaction date in the consecutive group (end)
    MAX(transaction_date) AS consecutive_end
FROM ConsecutiveTransactions
-- Group by customer_id and the computed consecutive group to find streaks
GROUP BY customer_id, grp
-- Filter to only include streaks with at least 3 consecutive transactions
HAVING COUNT(1) >= 3
-- Order the result by customer_id for better readability
ORDER BY customer_id;
