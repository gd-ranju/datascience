The install date of a player is the first login day of that player.

We define day one retention of some date x to be the number of players whose install date is x and they logged back in on the day right after x, divided by the number of players whose install date is x, rounded to 2 decimal places.

Write a solution to report for each install date, the number of players that installed the game on that day, and the day one retention.

Return the result table in any order.

The result format is in the following example.




# Write your MySQL query statement below
WITH
    T AS (
        SELECT
            player_id,
            event_date,
            MIN(event_date) OVER (PARTITION BY player_id) AS install_dt
        FROM Activity
    )
SELECT
    install_dt,
    COUNT(DISTINCT player_id) AS installs,
    ROUND(
        SUM(DATEDIFF(event_date, install_dt) = 1) / COUNT(DISTINCT player_id),
        2
    ) AS day1_retention
FROM T
GROUP BY 1;
