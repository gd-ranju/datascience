-- Step 1: Define platform categories for each spending date
WITH Platform_Categories AS (
    SELECT DISTINCT spend_date, 'desktop' AS platform FROM Spending
    UNION ALL
    SELECT DISTINCT spend_date, 'mobile' FROM Spending
    UNION ALL
    SELECT DISTINCT spend_date, 'both' FROM Spending
),

-- Step 2: Aggregate user spending per day and determine platform category
User_Spending AS (
    SELECT
        user_id,
        spend_date,
        SUM(amount) AS total_spent,  -- Total amount spent by user per day
        -- Identify if the user used only one platform or both
        IF(COUNT(platform) = 1, platform, 'both') AS platform 
    FROM Spending
    GROUP BY user_id, spend_date
)

-- Step 3: Join platform categories with user spending data
SELECT
    pc.spend_date,  -- Date of spending
    pc.platform AS platform_category,  -- Platform category (desktop, mobile, both)
    COALESCE(SUM(us.total_spent), 0) AS total_amount_spent,  -- Total amount spent per platform per day
    COUNT(us.user_id) AS total_users  -- Count of users per platform per day
FROM Platform_Categories AS pc
LEFT JOIN User_Spending AS us 
    ON pc.spend_date = us.spend_date 
    AND pc.platform = us.platform_category  -- Match by date and platform category
GROUP BY pc.spend_date, pc.platform  -- Aggregate by date and platform category
ORDER BY pc.spend_date, pc.platform;  -- Sort results for readability
