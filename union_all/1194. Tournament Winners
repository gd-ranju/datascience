The winner in each group is the player who scored the maximum total points within the group. In the case of a tie, the lowest player_id wins.
Write a solution to find the winner in each group.
Return the result table in any order.



-- Step 1: Combine scores for both first and second players in each match
WITH PlayerScores AS (
    SELECT first_player AS player_id, first_score AS score, group_id
    FROM Matches AS m
    JOIN Players AS p ON m.first_player = p.player_id

    UNION ALL

    SELECT second_player AS player_id, second_score AS score, group_id
    FROM Matches AS m
    JOIN Players AS p ON m.second_player = p.player_id
),

-- Step 2: Aggregate total scores for each player within their group
TotalScores AS (
    SELECT group_id, player_id, SUM(score) AS total_score
    FROM PlayerScores
    GROUP BY group_id, player_id
),

-- Step 3: Rank players within each group based on total score (higher is better)
RankedPlayers AS (
    SELECT
        group_id,
        player_id,
        RANK() OVER PARTITION BY group_id ORDER BY total_score DESC, player_id ASC ) AS ranking
    FROM TotalScores
)

-- Step 4: Select top-ranked players (highest total score) from each group
SELECT group_id, player_id
FROM RankedPlayers
WHERE ranking = 1;
