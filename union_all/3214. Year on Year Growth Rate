Table: user_transactions

+------------------+----------+
| Column Name      | Type     | 
+------------------+----------+
| transaction_id   | integer  |
| product_id       | integer  |
| spend            | decimal  |
| transaction_date | datetime |
+------------------+----------+
The transaction_id column uniquely identifies each row in this table.
Each row of this table contains the transaction ID, product ID, the spend amount, and the transaction date.
Write a solution to calculate the year-on-year growth rate for the total spend for each product.

The result table should include the following columns:

year: The year of the transaction.
product_id: The ID of the product.
curr_year_spend: The total spend for the current year.
prev_year_spend: The total spend for the previous year.
yoy_rate: The year-on-year growth rate percentage, rounded to 2 decimal places.
Return the result table ordered by product_id,year in ascending order.

The result format is in the following example.

 

Example:

Input:

user_transactions table:

+----------------+------------+---------+---------------------+
| transaction_id | product_id | spend   | transaction_date    |
+----------------+------------+---------+---------------------+
| 1341           | 123424     | 1500.60 | 2019-12-31 12:00:00 |
| 1423           | 123424     | 1000.20 | 2020-12-31 12:00:00 |
| 1623           | 123424     | 1246.44 | 2021-12-31 12:00:00 |
| 1322           | 123424     | 2145.32 | 2022-12-31 12:00:00 |
+----------------+------------+---------+---------------------+
Output:

+------+------------+----------------+----------------+----------+
| year | product_id | curr_year_spend| prev_year_spend| yoy_rate |
+------+------------+----------------+----------------+----------+
| 2019 | 123424     | 1500.60        | NULL           | NULL     |
| 2020 | 123424     | 1000.20        | 1500.60        | -33.35   |
| 2021 | 123424     | 1246.44        | 1000.20        | 24.62    |
| 2022 | 123424     | 2145.32        | 1246.44        | 72.12    |
